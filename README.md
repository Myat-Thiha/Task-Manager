# Task Manager Application

The Task Manager Application is a simple Java GUI program built using Swing. It allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, and deleting them in a table-based interface.

## Features

- **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks by entering task details such as name, description, and due date.
- **Edit Task:** Tasks can be edited by selecting a task from the table and modifying its details.
- **Delete Task:** Tasks can be deleted by selecting them from the table and clicking the delete button.
- **Table Display:** Tasks are displayed in a table format with columns for task name, description, and due date.
- **Task Completion:** Tasks can be marked as completed, although this feature is not fully implemented in the provided code.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java code using any Java compiler (e.g., `javac TaskManager.java`).
3. Run the compiled bytecode using Java (e.g., `java TaskManager`).

## Usage

1. Launch the Task Manager application.
2. Use the input fields at the top to add new tasks. Enter the task name, description, and due date, then click "Add Task."
3. Select a task from the table to edit or delete it using the corresponding buttons.
4. Edit the task details in the input fields and click "Edit Task" to save changes.
5. Click "Delete Task" to remove the selected task from the list.

## File Structure

- `TaskManager.java`: Contains the main code for the Task Manager application.

## Development Environment

- Java Development Kit (JDK) for Java programming.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or NetBeans for easier development and debugging.

## Dependencies

- Swing and AWT libraries for GUI components.
- `javax.swing`, `javax.swing.table`, `java.awt`, `java.awt.event` packages.

## Credits

This Task Manager application was created by [Myat-Thiha] as a simple project to demonstrate Java Swing GUI programming.
